2015-11-28 14:44:50	deadrat	Hi All. Does recent items GNOME extensions work for you in Fedora 23. It doesn't work for me.
2015-11-28 14:44:51	deadrat	I actually upgraded from f22 and I had some problem with other GNOME extensions too. But once I removed them and added again, it got fixed. Except for this.
2015-11-28 14:44:53	deadrat	I tried both extensions, nothing works. https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/72/recent-items/ https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/977/recent-items/
2015-11-28 14:44:54	deadrat	Thank you.
2015-11-28 14:46:16	pcdoctor2	I'm having problems with gnome myself.  It's not showing me the list of apps to download, gets stuck in checking for updates when I click update tab, keyboard is putting numbers in automatically

2015-11-28 15:41:09	tytan	bitlord Thank you very much. Which one will give me the best downloading performance? I have 200Mbit downspeed available
2015-11-28 15:41:35	bitlord	but if you do fresh install, I suggest you to use latest f23, both f22 and f23 KDE have new KDE, but with f23 you get "longer" life-cycle
2015-11-28 15:42:05	kk4ewt	bitlord,  unless they have nvidia (not completely out yet)

2015-11-28 15:42:25	bitlord	ok, I understand now
2015-11-28 15:42:52	kk4ewt	tytan,  hopefully this week rpmfusion will get them out of testing (new nvidia driver)
2015-11-28 15:42:56	bitlord	kk4ewt, I forgot about live-respins, they can be very useful for fresh installs now
2015-11-28 15:43:49	kk4ewt	bitlord,  thats why i make them :)
2015-11-28 15:44:04	bitlord	if it is in testing, and works, he can probably enable testing repo and try it?
2015-11-28 15:44:14	kk4ewt	that way people can install and not have to download another GB of updates
2015-11-28 15:44:19	tytan	So it doesn't take long to do that? If so I could wait a weak

2015-11-28 18:52:29	sdgathman	I thought booting from CSM might affect suspend/resume or something.
2015-11-28 18:52:39	fenrus02	i've got old hw that doesnt do uefi yet - not the best test candidate to ask really. iirc, thats anything newer than ~2013 has uefi.

2015-11-28 20:11:11	fenrus02	sdgathman, "could" in theory, but unlikely considering.
2015-11-28 20:11:24	fenrus02	swex_, run "fpaste --sysinfo" from your 'server' and post the url.  no ui is required for it.

2015-11-28 20:16:37	swex_	fenrus02: its installed by default
2015-11-28 20:16:57	fenrus02	swex_, why does a "server" have to be located remotely and require a wcdma stick?
2015-11-28 20:17:30	swex_	fenrus02: thats monitoring device that collects data from several sensors
2015-11-28 20:17:49	sdgathman	swex_: If you are truly deploying servers in remote locations (gathering weather info, for instance), you probably want to be using mesh software.
2015-11-28 20:17:53	fenrus02	swex_, "default" is meaningless.

2015-11-28 20:18:16	tytan	hello, everyone. I just installed F22 KDE in VBox 5.0.10 and I can't update my system. Can I fpaste you some useful information?
2015-11-28 20:18:46	sdgathman	swex_: Tell us the problem you are trying to solve.  When you say "server", fenrus02 pictures a box in a data center or closet with wired network.
2015-11-28 20:18:47	swex_	sdgathman: any links I can improve my knowledge about that
2015-11-28 20:18:48	fenrus02	swex_, for a real server located remotely, you should really consider centos instead.  it has a MUCH longer lifespan per release and is far more stable.
2015-11-28 20:19:24	swex_	I have several those monitoring/collecting devices
2015-11-28 20:19:32	fenrus02	and?
2015-11-28 20:19:38	fenrus02	how does that relate to anything at all?
2015-11-28 20:19:44	swex_	and I want them to connect  to any usb modem inserted into
2015-11-28 20:19:45	sdgathman	swex_: the two mesh technologies I have played with are batman-adv and cjdns
2015-11-28 20:20:30	tytan	I'm just getting update errors.
2015-11-28 20:21:07	fenrus02	swex_, your story is getting more convoluted and unnecessarily odd.  i'll come back when you've figured out your real goal.  meanwhile, i've given you two pieces of advice above already that would solve your issue if you actually told the truth above.
2015-11-28 20:21:50	sdgathman	If you use a mesh, the nodes ("servers") have neighbors (preferably more than one) reachable by Wifi (or wire if it is an indoor location).
2015-11-28 20:22:00	tytan	fenrus02: hey, do you know how to solve my update errors in f22?
2015-11-28 20:22:13	swex_	sdgathman: I dont need mesh in my case for sure
2015-11-28 20:22:15	fenrus02	tytan, sure.  dont use vbox.
2015-11-28 20:22:35	sdgathman	swex_: then what problem are you trying to solve?
2015-11-28 20:22:47	tytan	Do you think it's related to vbox? F23 doesn't have that problem on my native hardware though

2015-11-28 20:24:11	sdgathman	monitoring devices are ideal candidates for mesh
2015-11-28 20:24:27	fenrus02	tytan, of course you can ask.  but you wont like the answer, so just continue on your merry way and maybe someone else can help you.
2015-11-28 20:24:38	swex_	sdgathman: :) I just need to auto connect to any usb rndis modem inserted in my device
2015-11-28 20:25:21	tytan	Watch out everyone, we got a badass over here :D
2015-11-28 20:26:02	fenrus02	tytan, not really.  i specifically didnt answer you until you called my name.  there's a reason.
2015-11-28 20:26:12	sdgathman	swex_: that is a *means*.  You're goal is probably to have access to the "server" while it is in the field, and have it transmit the data it gathers.

2015-11-28 23:05:10	Mac101	hmm nope well i mean someone early told me it wasnt ready
2015-11-28 23:05:24	Mac101	i was trying to get mpv or vlc working with hardware accel
2015-11-28 23:05:38	Mac101	mpv wasnt in rpmf23
2015-11-28 23:05:54	Mac101	and cant get vlc working
2015-11-28 23:06:15	Khaytsus	Odd.  mpv is in 22, although I still use mplayer for some reason..  but I'm not watching anything big
2015-11-28 23:06:39	Mac101	i told everyone is moving to mpv cause its got active dev

2015-11-28 23:07:26	Mac101	when i did get it working it does seem to work fine apart from an ffmpeg warning which is assume is due to f23 ffmpeg

2015-11-28 23:08:29	Mac101	about the waiting for third party thing, dont all distro release need to waiting for third parties like gnome to be ready anyway?
2015-11-28 23:08:45	Mac101	isnt the whole os a composition of third party software
2015-11-28 23:09:10	Khaytsus	Very different.
2015-11-28 23:09:18	Mac101	man my typing is horrid today (apologies)
2015-11-28 23:09:19	Khaytsus	rpmfusion is a repo that Fedora does not need at all.
2015-11-28 23:10:00	Khaytsus	And as for something like Gnome..  Nope..  They make a decision, is it going to be ready for release or is the old version shipped, with a possible update.  It all depends.
2015-11-28 23:10:19	Khaytsus	But that said, Fedora would not stop ship for a Gnome release, unless it was something super important I guess.
2015-11-28 23:10:28	Mac101	are you a dev?
2015-11-28 23:10:31	Khaytsus	Because if you want for everyone, you'll never release.

2015-11-29 11:28:54	macieks	I'm using F23 x86_64 and wanted to install skype... I found that there's lpf-skype package and tried that but it failes on the installation process
2015-11-29 11:28:57	macieks	looks like gstreamer x86_64 conflicts with gstreamer i686 which is a dependency for skype
2015-11-29 11:29:01	macieks	I tried to find some similar problems but no one mentions having that problem
2015-11-29 11:29:13	macieks	error when install skype RPM package :
2015-11-29 11:29:17	macieks	http://pastebin.com/E6GaKuXj
2015-11-29 11:29:36	macieks	I tried installing it like this: dnf -y install http://download.skype.com/linux/skype-4.3.0.37-fedora.i586.rpm
2015-11-29 11:29:47	macieks	and those messages are from this command

2015-11-29 11:31:49	Zord	macieks, have you done dnf update ?
2015-11-29 11:32:12	macieks	the main problem seems to be that one can't install gstreamer1-plugins-base-1.6.1-1.fc23.i686 together with the x86_64 version
2015-11-29 11:32:31	Zord	As it seems like the x86_64 packages are older than the .i686 ones
2015-11-29 11:32:43	macieks	oh... looks like I have two gsteramer packages: gstreamer1-plugins-base-1.6.1-1.fc23.x86_64
2015-11-29 11:32:46	macieks	gstreamer1-plugins-base-1.6.0-1.fc23.x86_64
2015-11-29 11:32:50	macieks	weired I'll remove one
2015-11-29 11:32:55	Zord	glib2-2.46.2-1.fc23.i686 vs glib2-2.46.1-2.fc23.x86_64 for instance
2015-11-29 11:33:12	Zord	So have you actually done dnf update?
2015-11-29 11:33:25	macieks	I did dnf upgrade...
2015-11-29 11:33:52	Zord	And did it list anything to install?
2015-11-29 11:33:56	Zord	(or update)
2015-11-29 11:34:24	macieks	I did it yestearday and installed all, I run it one more time to have all latest package
2015-11-29 11:34:37	macieks	but there's no gstreamer there today

2015-11-29 18:05:35	fenrus02	smaug, use the cli tool instead.  it'll work.

2015-11-29 18:05:43	Mac101	my goal is to create the same sort of outgoing control i had on windows with a 3rd party firewall

2015-11-29 18:07:11	otila	but there is no proxy for every app

2015-11-29 18:07:20	fenrus02	otila, you sure about that?
2015-11-29 18:07:37	fenrus02	otila, i use a great many proxies for everything, from web traffic to irc ..
2015-11-29 18:07:47	oceanpollen	otila, unrelated to whatever this question actually is, that uid filtering only works for output.  any UID process can still listen on the port.
2015-11-29 18:08:21	Mac101	fenrus02 do you use squid then?
2015-11-29 18:08:29	otila	oceanpollen: but not establish new connections if iptables blocks it
2015-11-29 18:08:32	oceanpollen	well I would assume that not being to output processes would break things before a connection could be established...
2015-11-29 18:08:40	oceanpollen	*packets
2015-11-29 18:08:44	fenrus02	Mac101, sure. it works.
2015-11-29 18:09:08	oceanpollen	better test it.  I was worried about servers getting information from requests even if they couldn't reply.
2015-11-29 18:09:56	otila	tested already > 10 years ago
2015-11-29 18:10:09	Mac101	otila with your method how do you run gui apps as different uids?
2015-11-29 18:10:23	Mac101	gksu?
2015-11-29 18:10:56	oceanpollen	mac, xauth
2015-11-29 18:11:15	Mac101	otila also how did you get round dnf updating as that requires opening lots of stuff in iptables?
2015-11-29 18:11:19	otila	Mac101: xauth forwarding unfortunately, waiting till wayland gets something like that working

2015-11-29 19:34:28	Mac101	and that a user should have the option to choose even if this is granted byt default
2015-11-29 19:34:37	Mac101	s/ is/ isnt
2015-11-29 19:34:58	ladies	Mac101: what functionality? You can open/close ports relatively easy.
2015-11-29 19:35:28	otila	ladies: not a standard userspace API to call about it, but if it doesn't get connections established, it might warn about it :D
2015-11-29 19:36:12	Mac101	ladies but not for specific applications, without an elaborate solution involving passing apps through a proxy
2015-11-29 19:37:06	Mac101	or creating another user and xforwarding

2015-11-29 19:40:35	Mac101	nope if user enables outgoing control, they are taking responsibility for opening the right ports, for apps
2015-11-29 19:40:38	Mac101	as on windows
2015-11-29 19:41:10	Mac101	like with windows outgoing firewalls preconfigured rules could exist and be shared etc

2015-11-29 19:41:47	ladies	Sorry, I cannot follow the 'like with windows' bit because I haven't used windows since windows 7.
2015-11-29 19:42:10	ladies	even then I didn't 'use' it.
2015-11-29 19:42:32	oceanpollen	more like 'like with Android', which is able to do this with iptables because apps actually all are run under different UIDs

2015-11-29 20:45:04	GillesM	It is my first time on fedora
2015-11-29 20:45:04	GillesM	I use Debian or ubuntu ...
2015-11-29 20:45:11	muep	afaik httpd in fedora defaults to listening to all ip addresses
2015-11-29 20:45:44	GillesM	I installed fedora to learn SELinux

2015-11-29 20:46:04	muep	I pretty much never need to configure specific ip addresses to httpd. but you need to open http port in firewall if you want other hosts to reach your httpd in port 80
2015-11-29 20:46:54	GillesM	whttpd    1661   root    4u  IPv6  25036      0t0  TCP *:80 (LISTEN)

2015-11-29 20:48:07	kk4ewt	GillesM,  it uses firewalld to talk to iptables
2015-11-29 20:48:25	GillesM	how do I kill Firewalld

2015-11-29 20:49:40	muep	systemctl stop firewalld would stop it
2015-11-29 20:50:07	muep	but if you need to know selinux, you should likely also know how to manage a firewall tool
2015-11-29 20:50:32	muep	the command I gave should open the http port for you

2015-11-30 08:09:57	Sakyl	Hi there. Im sitting next to a freind of mine and we are trying to compile some c++ stuff. but it seems not to be working, since he upgraded to 23. The SDL2 Libraries seem to disappear and are not anymore in the standard directories, so cmake can find it. has anyone experiences same problems?

2015-12-01 01:14:13	Drugo	Hello. When the akmod-nvidia for f23 is expected to be ready? According to nvidia's site, they added support for xorg 1.18
2015-12-01 01:14:34	celexi	its been ready and working for a while
2015-12-01 01:14:55	celexi	it is not in rpmfusion stable its in testing
2015-12-01 01:15:08	Drugo	celexi, ah ok, thanks
2015-12-01 01:16:36	onezuff	i've reached my breaking point. the only way to get simplescreenrecorder to work was to install the russianfedora repo. have i shot myself in the foot? can this repo be trusted/
2015-12-01 01:16:54	celexi	when i tried it i just compiled it from source
2015-12-01 01:16:59	onezuff	i've given up on akmod-nvidia. i get really bad random jerking and skipping and csgo. makes GDM unusable. and to as of today also adds complications when trying to use simplescreenrecorder
2015-12-01 01:16:59	celexi	it has a simple script that does all
2015-12-01 01:17:21	onezuff	the script won't compile for me now celexi, it did yesterday but the nvidia drivers broke my system. new install, now it wont compile
2015-12-01 01:17:29	onezuff	just installed it from russian repo because i just really need it to work
2015-12-01 01:17:44	celexi	did you try reinstalling the nvidia drivers?
2015-12-01 01:17:51	onezuff	god no
2015-12-01 01:18:02	onezuff	the compile issue  was saying that GCC was not on the system
2015-12-01 01:18:36	onezuff	im giving up on nvidia/linux and wont be playing anymore cs:Go
2015-12-01 01:19:06	celexi	thats really odd
2015-12-01 01:19:08	onezuff	it was an awful experience that caused my game to reliably sputter and freeze every 2-3 minutes which almost always got me killed
2015-12-01 01:19:17	onezuff	even after multiple clean re-installs
2015-12-01 01:19:26	celexi	reinstalls of what ?
2015-12-01 01:19:38	onezuff	fedora 22 and i tried it on Arch and got the same result
2015-12-01 01:19:58	celexi	what nvidia driver version are you running?
2015-12-01 01:20:10	celexi	sounds like a hardware problem
2015-12-01 01:20:15	onezuff	i think it was 340xx but i can't remember
2015-12-01 01:20:22	celexi	340???????
2015-12-01 01:20:25	celexi	thats really old
2015-12-01 01:20:30	celexi	or you have a really old gpu

2015-12-01 01:20:49	Drugo	i need 304, even older :)
2015-12-01 01:20:56	onezuff	it might have been 304xx i dont remember as i said
2015-12-01 01:21:04	celexi	there is zero reason for you to use any of those
2015-12-01 01:21:06	onezuff	i tried all of them at one point
2015-12-01 01:21:17	onezuff	even installed the thing from nvidia's site directly
2015-12-01 01:21:26	celexi	did you try 358?
2015-12-01 01:21:39	fenrus02	tried the negativo repo?
2015-12-01 01:21:40	celexi	should mention for 358 to work in fedora 22 you need to disable selinux
2015-12-01 01:21:43	onezuff	i dont know
2015-12-01 01:21:58	celexi	you can use 358 in 23 withotu disabling selinux
2015-12-01 01:22:01	celexi	as its in rpmfusion
2015-12-01 01:22:07	fenrus02	if "disable selinux" is the answer, you're doing something very wrong.

2015-12-01 01:24:08	fenrus02	celexi, that has a patch already, so it does not require that you disabled selinux.
2015-12-01 01:24:23	vbgunz	I've just used vgrename on my system and edited /boot/grub2/grub.cfg, /etc/default/grub, /etc/fstab and then dracut -v -f -H --regenerate-all... now I can't update grub using grub2-mkconfig ... it's complaining /usr/sbin/grub2-probe: error: failed to get canonical path of ‘/dev/mapper/fedora-root’. but I changed all that I should?
2015-12-01 01:24:25	onezuff	how do you guys keep track of all these bugs in the distros? are you guys developers? i feel i can't understand half that bugzilla thing haha
2015-12-01 01:24:26	epk	fenrus02, yeah, that's what i'm going to do. figured i would make a last ditch attempt. thanks for all of your help?

2015-12-01 01:38:57	onezuff	what?
2015-12-01 01:39:08	fenrus02	onezuff, if i were you, i'd use that in a docker container.  easier to manage the overhead.
2015-12-01 01:39:23	onezuff	what has keyloggers? ubuntu or docker?
2015-12-01 01:39:57	fenrus02	onezuff, the canonical distros (ALL OF THEM) track a bunch of details about the users.  you can google for details.
2015-12-01 01:40:05	onezuff	oh god
2015-12-01 01:40:17	fenrus02	onezuff, docker is fine, use it for all your apps if you wish.  works well.
2015-12-01 01:40:18	onezuff	i dont want that
2015-12-01 01:40:29	fenrus02	docker is not a distro .. just a container.

2015-12-01 07:22:02	vbgunz	well, one thing you can try is to kill kwin then plasmashell during a test of something you know for a fact tears.
2015-12-01 07:22:18	vbgunz	I had issues where either kwin or plasmashell would cause the tearing

2015-12-01 07:23:24	vbgunz	the only way to fix it is to kill one or both of those, I don't know, I kill both by default
2015-12-01 07:24:06	vbgunz	it's not an answer, just seeing what could be the cause of the problem if it works

2015-12-01 07:25:55	amnix	vbgunz, the tearing happens when anything moves on a screen. whether that's a video, a window moving, or anything else... it's really annoying and I can't seem to find anything to fix it.

2015-12-01 07:28:18	amnix	plasmashell? I don't even have that installed. I'm on fedora 23

2015-12-01 07:31:24	NuSuey	support also so bad here?
2015-12-01 07:31:26	vbgunz	not sure, I'm on nvidia and had plenty of problems with tearing. I've got many fixes for myself but they're either nvidia or kde specific, sorry :(

2015-12-01 07:34:08	vbgunz	man I can't wait for wayland
2015-12-01 07:34:35	rgralinski	Not to come across ignorant but what exactly does Wayland do
2015-12-01 07:34:38	vbgunz	NuSuey: the only suggestion I have is passing -v to rpm when you do the install
2015-12-01 07:35:07	vbgunz	the feature I'm most excited about with wayland is its promise for a tear free experience
2015-12-01 07:35:46	vbgunz	that to me matters a lot as I use one pc to game, htpc, etc and tearing I hate quite a bit. I very quickly notice it
2015-12-01 07:36:13	rgralinski	It's a display server?
2015-12-01 07:36:25	rgralinski	Like to replace xorg?
2015-12-01 07:36:32	vbgunz	yeah
2015-12-01 07:36:51	rgralinski	Hmm interesting never heard of it

2015-12-01 07:38:54	NuSuey	okay, so another question.. is there a way how to downgrade packages in fedora?
2015-12-01 07:39:45	rgralinski	I know you could with yum not sure about dnf try yum downgrade package
2015-12-01 07:40:04	vbgunz	I recently did that but forgot but one note, you'll also have to add the files you don't want upgraded to a conf somewhere otherwise they'll get upgraded again pretty quickly as I understand it
2015-12-01 07:40:34	rgralinski	Yes
2015-12-01 07:40:39	rgralinski	What he said
2015-12-01 07:41:19	rgralinski	I recently upgraded to 22 my first time seeing dnf and i don't like it
2015-12-01 07:41:29	NuSuey	ah, so there is no clever gui where I could just pick a package and set it to downgrade? liked the octopi simplesness in arch
2015-12-01 07:42:14	vbgunz	not sure, maybe, one sec, I know where I can find a hint for you, let me see

2015-12-01 07:45:37	rgralinski	Oh well downgrading packages is pretty easy on it even if they're is no gui I just can't say on that one
2015-12-01 07:45:39	NuSuey	also haven't found out how can you install a nvidia gpu driver and if  you need it install this way always or is it being updated everytime your system is..
2015-12-01 07:45:48	rgralinski	That's easy
2015-12-01 07:46:03	vbgunz	man dnf.conf and search "/" for exclude, the file it's referencing is /etc/dnf/dnf.conf
2015-12-01 07:46:17	rgralinski	Just Google Nvidia on fedora there's a site that has walk through fire all versions it will be like the first result
2015-12-01 07:46:24	vbgunz	that's just to keep your downgrades packages from upgrading again behind your back

2015-12-01 07:48:28	rgralinski	Not if you install it by rpm which is just as easy you just add the repo to your dnf or yum

2015-12-03 02:51:44	basil1x	Is there a button or key combination to turn the trackpad on/off?  If so, try toggling it a few times.

I can log in just fine on a non-graphical tty, so I think fedora itself is fine, but I don't really know where to begin troubleshooting this. Anything I should be checking

The problem I have in fedora is that whenever I move windows or watch videos, I experience screen tearing issues. This does not happen in Ubuntu. What can I do in fedora to get this fixed? I am using Intel HD 5500 graphics.

2015-12-03 17:12:18	amnix	Southern_Gentlem: I've tried that fix. It gets rid of the tearing. But what it does it reduces performance. So when I would move windows around, the cursor would move first and then the window would follow a bit later. It's not as smooth.
2015-12-03 17:12:28	@Southern_Gentlem	i suggest you put selinux into permissive untill you get it all set up then setroubleshoot will tell you what to fix and then you can go back to enforce

2015-12-03 17:18:48	@Southern_Gentlem	tytan,  after all all those distros are downstream for fedora
2015-12-03 17:19:31	tytan	Southern_Gentlem: I haven't noticed selinux in Debian based distros yet. I'm getting curious about it.
2015-12-03 17:19:49	badbodh	amnix, well. the trick is to basically force vsync. so cpu load is to be expected. unless you have an antique PC shouldn;t be a problem.
2015-12-03 17:21:07	badbodh	i never got lag issues like you mention. you can remove the 20-intel.conf, reboot and check if tearing starts.
2015-12-03 17:21:18	@Southern_Gentlem	tytan, and debian isnt downstream for fedora now is it
2015-12-03 17:21:22	amnix	badbodh: Without adding that file, windows move in sync with the mouse cursor. After I've added the tearfree option, the cursor moves first and then the window follows a bit later. It's not really a big problem but it's annoying.
2015-12-03 17:21:41	Zord	tytan, you can set it up for Debian, if you want: https://wiki.debian.org/SELinux/Setup
2015-12-03 17:22:41	badbodh	amnix, you may remove the 20-intel.conf then, better tear than lag :D
2015-12-03 17:22:59	amnix	badbodh: there's no way to have no tearing and no lag?
2015-12-03 17:23:29	amnix	badbodh: on ubuntu, for example, this doesn't happen.

2015-12-03 22:42:57	Usurp	bitlord: what can I do then ? I want to upgrade a fedora 18 (spherical cow) system.
2015-12-03 22:43:43	--	memes is now known as gamma
2015-12-03 22:43:56	bitlord	Usurp, maybe better to do a "fresh install" if possible keep important data (also make backup first)
2015-12-03 22:44:37	bitlord	Usurp, other way is using yum ... to upgrade, but f18 is "too old"
2015-12-03 22:45:18	bitlord	and upgrading directly to some supported release can break your system (too big jump I guess, but maybe it can work, who knows)

2015-12-03 22:47:45	bitlord	Usurp, if you have a separate user data (/home) you can custom partition new fedora install, and do a fresh install keeping /home and data inside it
2015-12-03 22:48:09	bitlord	I cannot remember now, 1~2 releases, maybe more :S
2015-12-03 22:48:57	Usurp	let me guess... since systemd landing ?

2015-12-04 05:02:45	badbodh	on xfce look for "window manager tweaks" in control panel, and in kde check out "desktop effects" section

2015-12-04 05:14:01	fedpop	amnix what happens if you use wayland
2015-12-04 05:14:04	badbodh	just tearfree fixes tearing in limited cases. like i found my flash videos tearing even after that. so i add everything.
2015-12-04 05:15:11	amnix	fedpop: No tearing when I use wayland. But I can't be using that on my production machine though, right? Also the scrolling when using wayland feels really weird.
2015-12-04 05:15:27	fedpop	its tradeoffs really, if wayland works use it
2015-12-04 05:15:46	amnix	fedpop: So all of this is happening because of X?
2015-12-04 05:16:17	badbodh	wayland tears horribly on mine. can't blame it on X either

2015-12-04 05:20:22	badbodh	amnix, just a stupid thought, open gnome-tweak-tool and disable animations. see if any change
2015-12-04 05:21:48	amnix	badbodh: How will that help? Disabling the animations might reduce the tearing that happened in the animations but I'll still have tearing when moving windows around or watching videos, don't you think?
2015-12-04 05:22:38	badbodh	just do it and find out. i don;t have experimental or statistical data to back up my claim. turn it back on if it don;t work.
2015-12-04 05:22:42	amnix	badbodh: and to be honest, I don't really notice any tearing in the animations. just when moving windows and watching videos.

2015-12-04 14:35:30	tytan	Hello, everyone. I'm running Fedora Server for over a year now. I'm shutting my server down weekly and I do weekly backups. Is there a way to decrease the downtime? Maybe my behavior is just old fashioned ^^
2015-12-04 14:36:57	jhogarth	tytan, it depends on yoru requirements - why are you shutting down for backups ?
2015-12-04 14:37:31	<--	Aginaridan (agi@irc.javell.org) has quit (Ping timeout: 244 seconds)
2015-12-04 14:37:31	tytan	I shut down so all updated like kernel updates can take place.
2015-12-04 14:37:41	tytan	*updates
2015-12-04 14:38:24	randomuser	tytan, the thing to do these days is have redundant services.  If you use it for storage, use distributed storage
2015-12-04 14:38:48	randomuser	if you use it for a web server, have more than one with something like haproxy in front
2015-12-04 14:39:12	jhogarth	are you concerned about downtime for *updateS* or for *backups* ... because in your first message you didn't mention updates but your second implies them?

2015-12-04 14:41:58	jhogarth	tytan, the only way to do that then realistically is tp provide some sort of HA for your services over multiple systems and improve application/service uptime ... system uptime is semi-irrelevant in that context

2015-12-04 14:42:10	randomuser	yeah, configuring your long running services to start on boot is a good way to decrease downtime of those services
2015-12-04 14:42:11	tytan	The thing is That I have 20 to 30 users only all the time
2015-12-04 14:42:15	storrgie	I have a similar server for mumble and a couple other game related things. I log in each monday morning (when folks are not gaming) and do an update then reboot. All services come back online after reboot without intervention
2015-12-04 14:42:46	storrgie	jhogarth, he's talking about a gameserver, there is no HA for minecraft

2015-12-04 14:43:34	jhogarth	tytan, then you have a requirements (cost benefit analysis) for that decision ... a) is the extra hardware and complexity worth the cost to decrease downtime and b) what impact on those users is there for system/application/service failure ?
2015-12-04 14:43:37	storrgie	realistically though, tytan, you should get your services to be as independent as possible and have them boot via the service init system (systemd)
2015-12-04 14:44:12	jhogarth	storrgie, pfft .. show some imagination ... oVirt cluster with live in memory failover ustilising shared storage :P
2015-12-04 14:44:13	storrgie	and tytan, you should write up how you do this and share it with people, so that they can either critique your design or learn from it
2015-12-04 14:44:15	tytan	Ok, thanks for sharing your knowledge =)
2015-12-04 14:44:18	randomuser	tytan, jflory7 would probably know if a minecraft server exists that can scale out

2015-12-04 14:44:54	storrgie	tytan, I'd also suggest, instead of teamspek, use mumble. I believe there is a popular copr repo for fedora, it's already packaged well so that it will come right back online after reboot.
2015-12-04 14:45:25	storrgie	tytan, I know a lot of people prefer TS, but mumble does everything TS does, is open source, and is cryptographically rigorous.
2015-12-04 14:45:37	randomuser	storrgie, I believe that mumble is back in the main repos now
2015-12-04 14:45:57	tytan	storrgie: My customers all use TeamSpeak. The server is just what customers requested so far ^^
2015-12-04 14:45:59	storrgie	randomuser, that would be really great news... the ice dependency was very frustrating
2015-12-04 14:46:19	tytan	storrgie: BUT I will take a look at Mumble today. What you said sounds very interesting.
2015-12-04 14:46:31	storrgie	tytan, if they are paying you, different story. I run mine for friends and gaming acquaintances. I get to decide what they use
2015-12-04 14:47:06	tytan	Yeah, I get payed a little so the system pays for itself.

2015-12-04 20:13:13	striker	acidrainfall: the only requirement of having a copr repo is that it contains free software
2015-12-04 20:13:34	striker	beyond that, there is little to no official testing, no official bug fixes, etc.
2015-12-04 20:14:02	striker	if you want to trust a copr, you can do so.  however, no one is stating that they are 'stable'
2015-12-04 20:14:28	acidrainfall	The stability is less concerning to me than verification of source
2015-12-04 20:14:35	acidrainfall	i.e. I don't want ridealong-ware

I've just copy the PCF font to /usr/share/fonts/ folder and execute "fc-cache -fv" to update fonts, but it didn't add font. And I tried make ~/.font directory and put that font there, but it looks that only TTF format are supported.

2015-12-05 05:01:40	fenrus02	for what you did above, 'ss' is the replacement.  -t (tcp) -l (listening, completely optional above - not real useful, but does replicate what you had with netstat) -n (numeric) -a (all) -p (programs)

2015-12-05 15:27:36	fenrus02	instead, you want to measure "acceptable risk" levels to assess if the value of doing so outweighs the risk .. this is specific to your environment.
2015-12-05 15:27:54	Mac101	ok noted, my train of thought was as they are both my user accounts and i dont need to auth to run firefox in same account it might not matter, i will read up on why it does tho
2015-12-05 15:28:20	fenrus02	what gain do you have from running a browser as another user?
2015-12-05 15:28:28	fenrus02	is there another solution that already provides this?
2015-12-05 15:28:45	fenrus02	adding complexity decreases security.  keep it simple.

2015-12-05 16:22:51	gosang	savitr, if that directory exists, your system uses EFI. If it doesn't, it uses BIOS. As for your timeout problem: My /etc/default/grub only contains one timeout-related setting: GRUB_TIMEOUT=5 and it works as advertised. If you're on EFI, use Mac101's suggested grub2-mkconfig command, it has the correct path for grub.cfg on EFI systems

2015-12-05 16:42:14	gosang	So, my GNOME Shell has been very unstable ever since my upgrade to F23. Crashing randomly. Checking "journalctl /usr/bin/gnome-shell" reveals a ton of these errors: "shm_open() failed: No such file or directory" and "shm_open() failed: Too many open files". Also, some audio apps stop working after a while, i.e. Rhythmbox, with the same "shm_open failed" errors. How or where do I start debugging this? I've searched the web already, to no avail :(

2015-12-05 17:19:51	gosang	randomuser, I think I understand savitr's problem now: It's not the timeout, but the fact that grub stops at the boot menu (after the timeout), waiting for user input. this is probably related to GRUB_RECORDFAIL_TIMEOUT, which stops grub at the boot menu after power failure / failed boots

2015-12-05 17:39:31	randomuser	savitr, exactly.  That would be a quick way to answer a question like "is there any space between grub and -editenv" - hit the tab key, see what comes up

2015-12-05 17:41:48	gosang	savitr, have you tried changing the integer to something other than 5? 4, or 10? Just so we know that our /etc/default/grub setting actually take effect?
2015-12-05 17:42:13	inascime	i believe you have to rebuild grub2
2015-12-05 17:42:23	inascime	after changing it
2015-12-05 17:42:36	gosang	fedpop, the way I understand it: Grub2 does not continue after the timeout, it just waits for user to press ENTER (which *can* be a feature after failed boots)
2015-12-05 17:42:45	savitr	you are lucky guys in that aspect. I just have to wait for hitting enter. Once I powered on,I should see the gnome  login. but, everytime, I have to hit enter. it is kind of irks me that it is there, but not working.
2015-12-05 17:43:02	inascime	1. Change Timeout 2. Rebuild grub: grub2-mkconfig -o /boot/grub2/grub.cfg
2015-12-05 17:43:04	randomuser	savitr, http://paste.fedoraproject.org/297745/49337321 is my unmodified /etc/default/grub.  Start with that, run grub2-mkconfig to regenerate the config
2015-12-05 17:43:10	randomuser	start from a known good place, then edit.
2015-12-05 17:43:20	fedpop	oh ok. sounds like its not related to GRUB_TIMEOUT then.
2015-12-05 17:43:29	savitr	solutions on other sites from google search did not help me. that is why I came here.
2015-12-05 17:43:42	inascime	info grub2 is a great place for grub2 information btw
2015-12-05 17:43:43	gosang	savitr, we will figure it out sooner or later :D

2015-12-05 17:44:44	randomuser	savitr, I know you can.  Make a copy of yours just in case though.
2015-12-05 17:45:03	randomuser	savitr, the only one you'd have to change might be GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX
2015-12-05 17:45:26	gosang	yes, do not use someone else's GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX, use your own

2015-12-05 17:46:42	savitr	once I started desktop by pressing power button on desktop. I have to wait for grub2 menu. Then I have to hit enter to start fedora. grube menu shows all fedora entries with different kernel versions.first entry is the fedora with the latest  kernel version.

Checking "journalctl /usr/bin/gnome-shell" reveals a ton of these errors: "shm_open() failed: No such file or directory" and "shm_open() failed: Too many open files". Also, some audio apps stop working after a while, i.e. Rhythmbox, with the same "shm_open failed" errors. How or where do I start debugging this? I've searched the web already, to no avail :-(
2015-12-05 18:35:03	gosang	Somebody suggested raising the per-process fd limit (ulimit -n), which I did, from default 1024 to 4096. Didn't help.

2015-12-05 18:45:11	gosang	savitr, the command "grub-editenv create" clears (or recreates) an environment file used by grub. that sometimes helps to fix boot problems.
2015-12-05 18:45:40	savitr	some info like "--set=root 0b1aa062 ....."
2015-12-05 18:45:54	savitr	or like "root=UUID=432b1514- ...."
2015-12-05 18:46:31	savitr	i don't know completely about what info is kept  in that file like encryped root password
2015-12-05 18:47:03	randomuser	savitr, I do know, and I'm telling you there is nothing sensitive there, and we need to see all of it to help you
2015-12-05 18:47:09	gosang	savitr, I am a privacy-conscious person myself, but I agree with randomuser that grub.cfg does not hold much personal information. Feel free to remove the UUIDs, but they are generated randomly anyway and not tied to your hardware. There is no relation to your passwords.
2015-12-05 18:47:28	savitr	ok
2015-12-05 18:48:05	randomuser	I would prefer that you do not edit it at all
2015-12-05 18:48:28	savitr	anyway, i will post this question elsewhere.

2015-12-05 19:56:30	ezech	hi guys, I'm trying to run rfkill but it fails to see /dev/rfkill file (possibly because it's not there)
2015-12-05 19:56:51	randomuser	ezech, wifi trouble?
2015-12-05 19:57:09	ezech	randomuser, and it's a thinkpad, would you think that?
2015-12-05 19:57:31	randomuser	ezech, depends on which wireless module is in it... let's start there
2015-12-05 19:57:48	ezech	it's an intel 5300
2015-12-05 19:58:10	randomuser	ezech, are you able to connect with a wired interface and update the system?
2015-12-05 19:58:21	ezech	and I'm not really sure if I'm seeing things or not, but I remember it working for some time just after an install
2015-12-05 19:58:32	ezech	randomuser, I'm ircing from said machine, so yes
2015-12-05 19:59:06	randomuser	ezech, and all updates are applied, with a subsequent reboot? have you tried booting into each available kernel?
2015-12-05 19:59:38	ezech	oh, and it's an lenovo x200, os is up to date and rebooted many times today :)
2015-12-05 20:00:05	randomuser	same behavior with all kernels?
2015-12-05 20:00:21	ezech	I tried only the default one I think

2015-12-05 20:01:33	ezech	it's a 4.2.3-300.fc23.x86_64, right now lspci shows the device is present, but no modules regarding it are loaded so it's not visible on `ip a'
2015-12-05 20:01:44	 *	randomuser nods
2015-12-05 20:02:13	ezech	tried to modprobe iwlwifi but no module as well, I checked the intel-something-firmware packages - installed

2015-12-05 20:03:31	randomuser	ie iwl5000-firmware

2015-12-05 20:06:14	ezech	what's the deal with the rfkill software though?
2015-12-05 20:06:30	ezech	wasn't it suppose to at least list devices it can see?
2015-12-05 20:06:38	 *	randomuser shrugs
2015-12-05 20:06:59	ezech	I dunno, it just comes up quite often related to wifi problems on laptops :)
2015-12-05 20:07:00	randomuser	if it doesn't load the module for the device, you're not going to be able to work effectively with the device
2015-12-05 20:07:51	randomuser	ezech, as you try out different kernels, the output of ie `journalctl -kb|grep intel` or |grep iwl and such may be revealing

2015-12-06 00:18:00	jhogarth	morxa, no dependcy resolution (ie the transaction test) needs to pass
2015-12-06 00:18:07	jhogarth	what are you attempting to do ?
2015-12-06 00:19:42	morxa	After a failed F23 upgrade, I replayed a backup, but forgot to replay /var. So now dnf thinks it has F23 packages installed, but the system is a F22. So I figured to resolve the issue I would distro-sync, and then retry the upgrade
2015-12-06 00:20:02	morxa	But that fails because of file conflicts with the F22 packages installed
2015-12-06 00:22:26	morxa	I mean file conflicts with the files on the system, which dnf assumes not to be there
2015-12-06 00:23:29	jhogarth	well congratulations you borked your system impressively ... you can try to restore /var so things are consistent ... or you might get away with dnf reinstall \* to reinstall everything the rpm database says ... but your system is in such an inconsistent satte like that you could probbaly never trust it again (i mean what do you expect after partial restores of key system files on a filesystem?) so you'll probbably be better off backing up your data

2015-12-06 08:44:26	celexi	you can change it from greyscale to rgb and hinting on gnome tweak tool

2015-12-06 08:45:45	HarveyPwca	If you enable anti-aliasing, set the hinting to full and the sub-pixel order to rgb you should be getting quite adequate results. Even better on most laptop screens if you set the dpi to 96 the fonts will not look so large and "cartoonish".

2015-12-06 09:10:08	ovrflw0x	reading hurts, spoon feeding works

2015-12-06 17:56:04	bitlord	I'm not sure, but maybe that is true what pebe said, if you have gnome online accounts (some account with IM checked)
2015-12-06 17:56:08	pebe	SpaceInvaders: or keep it now that you know what it is :)
2015-12-06 17:56:31	SpaceInvaders	I've never setup google--but I have logged in to google on a "burner" acct because sometimes there's no avoiding it.

2015-12-06 20:07:48	tilpner	Disregarding any bugs, this looks like a safety guard against malicious plugins, that will request confirmation with a warning before actually running it.

2015-12-06 20:10:50	TheSuperGeek	ok
2015-12-06 20:10:55	tilpner	brolios - I believe this code is not meant to be run, and fedy will actually issue a warning if a plugin tries to do so.

BUT, when I do "ls ~/Desktop" from terminal, or try to open the torrent in VLC the file is simply not there!

2015-12-07 02:30:50	sinner-	my fault, works differently in ubuntu, perhaps the interaction between selinux and firejail

2015-12-07 02:33:27	sdgathman	I guess for primarily incoming data, like big downloads, the QoS has to happen in the gateway router (running CentOS6).
2015-12-07 02:33:50	sinner-	yeah so basically whats happening is this: im running firefox from within firejail, which is suid (then drops CAP_ROOT). this means that programs spawned by firefox are also jailed. this works fine in ubuntu (in terms of the problem im having) but i guess here selinux is setting filelabels as root rather than my user?
2015-12-07 02:34:14	sinner-	if i run transmission-gtk independently and paste the magnet link to it, i.e. not spawned inside the jail, it works correctly.
2015-12-07 02:34:27	sinner-	a little strange though, since firefox can download files without any issue

2015-12-07 02:36:34	chder	I don't think it's selinux but if it is you should see audit messages in the journal related to the directly. I think it's more likely your home directory was remounted as a tmpfs for the jailed app.
2015-12-07 02:36:55	Khaytsus	sinner-: Stuff in that thing are downloaded to a temporary filesystem which goes away when the browser is closed.
2015-12-07 02:38:10	sinner-	wtf. you guys are right. i just closed firefox and the file is gone
2015-12-07 02:38:25	sinner-	perhaps firejail featureset updated while i wasnt looking

2015-12-07 02:40:09	johnsz	what type of sandbox is firejail anyway? i just set up the selinux sandbox command with firefox just curious... saw the github page for firejail couldnt tell it was selinux as well or not
2015-12-07 02:40:20	sinner-	its basically a seccomp blacklist
2015-12-07 02:40:41	sinner-	so compromised firefox cannot access .ssh, .gnupg and ~/Documents, i installed it after that annoying PDF.js exploit
2015-12-07 02:41:10	johnsz	ah okay... i think ill like the selinux sandbox better then even if its a bit clunky at times it seems to work okay
2015-12-07 02:41:50	sinner-	theyre not really the same thing. selinux sandbox is for running ephemeral processes

2015-12-07 02:42:20	sinner-	firejail is just to essentially protect sensitive dirs from a process
2015-12-07 02:42:38	Khaytsus	Firefox in Docker is another way to do it ;)
2015-12-07 02:43:06	sinner-	docker is not a secure isolation mechanism, but all of the isolation features you could enable in docker are already handled in firejail
2015-12-07 02:43:17	johnsz	docker is a bit extreme... lol... might be hard to get that working correctly with youtube and crap
2015-12-07 02:43:24	sinner-	using docker+sVirt is probably the same as selinux sandbox
2015-12-07 02:43:41	johnsz	well svirt is selinux
2015-12-07 02:43:42	Khaytsus	How could something like the exploit you mentioned do anything useful in a Docker container that is only using Firefox?
2015-12-07 02:43:58	johnsz	so yeah its basically the same
2015-12-07 02:44:04	sinner-	johnsz: yes thats what i mean, the outcome is identical, one process running in its own selinux context

2015-12-07 07:17:51	Serpentoj	Hello.  I am trying to help someone get their audio working.  They have an ASUS Xonar DX.  PulseAudio sees the card, but trying to play something just makes the stream flicker in pavucontrol.  This happens no matter what profile it is set to.
2015-12-07 07:19:04	Smrtz	fenrus02, http://sprunge.us/ZfTN  Everything seems fine to me?
2015-12-07 07:19:29	Serpentoj	I had them get a log of what PulseAudio is trying to do when they play something.  It looks like the stream is getting stuck?  http://sprunge.us/SgNL

2015-12-07 13:09:02	kendell	has anyone ever heard of the following decoder? I've been trying to play a file that has an extention of mp4 but apparently isn't. The exact error I get is, cannot play the file audio/x-gst-fourcc-sawp codec is required. I've got gst good, bad, ugly and libav plugins installed. I'm stumped
2015-12-07 13:09:27	kendell	ffmpeg errors out, saying it can't figure out what type of file it is

2015-12-07 13:18:46	sobersabre	hi guys. I have a dns thingie I cannot resolve. I'm on f23, and the local domain is bla.local, I'm trying to resolve with nslookup and dig, and it works ok: IP-> host and host-> IP. but using google chrome - doesn't work.

2015-12-07 15:52:06	Southern_Gentlem	twirl so what command did you run to install kde
2015-12-07 15:52:44	Twirl	Southern_Gentlem: i tried lxde, dnf install @lxde-desktop
2015-12-07 15:53:08	Twirl	Southern_Gentlem: but now it looks like chrome is working fine with wayland... is this normal? why nobody said it could be the problem?
2015-12-07 15:53:20	jhogarth	alebeta, update it (you will probably need to fedup to F22 before you can dnf system-upgrade to F23 ... I'm not aware if dnf system-upgrade from F21 to F23 is supported or not)
2015-12-07 15:53:24	jhogarth	it may be though
2015-12-07 15:53:38	Southern_Gentlem	Twirl,  and that is not the way i told you above to install
2015-12-07 15:53:39	jhogarth	if you can yum install dnf-plugin-system-upgrade it ought to work ;)

2015-12-07 15:54:57	jhogarth	Southern_Gentlem, maybe ... fedora usually has an n-2 -> n policy ..
2015-12-07 15:55:10	jhogarth	if dnf-system-upgrade is in the f21 repos it ought to work
2015-12-07 15:55:20	jhogarth	if not then fedup to f22 then dnf to f23 would be needed
2015-12-07 15:55:30	Southern_Gentlem	jhogarth,  people had issues fedup n+2 and we hav3e seen people have the same issue with dnf

2015-12-07 15:56:03	Southern_Gentlem	twirl yes i did
2015-12-07 15:56:08	jhogarth	Southern_Gentlem, fedup was techniclaly broken by design in that respect (I was in on upgrade bug reports doing testing) due to the way it utilised switch-root between systemd version

2015-12-07 15:56:30	Southern_Gentlem	Twirl so install another DE like mate dnf grouplist dnf groupinstll "groupname"
2015-12-07 15:56:43	alebeta	jhogarth, ok i will schedule this update, because is a server in production u.u
2015-12-07 15:56:46	jhogarth	but do note I did advise he'll probably want to fedup first to f22
2015-12-07 15:56:59	jhogarth	alebeta, as always ensure good backups and a rollback plan ;)
2015-12-07 15:57:11	Twirl	Southern_Gentlem: alright

2015-12-07 17:08:16	Twirl	it's doing 13 things to the drive
2015-12-07 17:09:14	Sokel	That's normal.
2015-12-07 17:09:26	Sokel	Depending on what's already on the drive.
2015-12-07 17:09:30	Twirl	its a new drive let me show you
2015-12-07 17:10:49	ovrflw0x	Sokel, there's not fstrim.timer in /usr/lib/systemd...
2015-12-07 17:10:50	Sokel	Again, that's normal. Just let the installer do what it thinks is best. Long story short, it needs to create a 500mb partition for /boot, and then the second partition is a physical volume that will hold a volume group. The volume group will have any other partitions you may have. Default is / and /home

2015-12-07 17:15:12	Sokel	Twirl: the only thing that would be a legitimate concern is you may run into bootable media or otherwise that do not support EFI (like older software/distros).
2015-12-07 17:15:50	Sokel	You'll find fedora's ISO's will support EFI out of the box, so that isn't an issue. But I can't say the same for other media.

2015-12-07 20:41:56	embiopterid	Hello all. I am using openvswitch in fedora 23.  When selinux is set to enforce, openvswitch-nonetwork is unable to create and use netlink sockets in /var/run/openvswitch.  When I set selinux to permissive it works, but I am getting no selinux alerts that would help me fix the problem.  Any ideas?

I have a /dev/sdb1 partition that I intend to use for grub, and a /dev/sdb2 that is a pv (currently pvmoving my data).  I just ran grub2-install --boot-directory=/mnt/newBootDrive /dev/sdb.  This seems ok, I see grub2 in my /mnt/newBootDrive, but no initramfs.  Do I need initramfs? If so how do I install it?

2015-12-08 06:02:55	Twirl	whats hidpi? u on gnome?
2015-12-08 06:03:11	sub_pop	yea, GNOME on a Macbook Pro. HiDPI is "retina"

2015-12-08 06:06:46	Grinnz	ah, wayland is a likely reason then
2015-12-08 06:07:01	sub_pop	yea. looks like filezilla uses wxGTK
2015-12-08 06:07:02	Grinnz	lots of apps still dont work in wayland

2015-12-08 06:09:26	sub_pop	yea, that's our theory. filezilla uses wxGTK which might not work well on wayland
2015-12-08 06:09:31	Twirl	sub_pop: do you know any alternatives to wayland i could try because the default one or classic are incompatible with google-chrome which i also need for work
2015-12-08 06:09:59	Twirl	any way to fix it?
2015-12-08 06:10:13	sub_pop	nope. can you run x11, and run a wayland instance nested inside that for the wayland chrome?
2015-12-08 06:10:45	Twirl	that sounds really complicated and silly
2015-12-08 06:11:13	sub_pop	lol
2015-12-08 06:11:37	sub_pop	wayland is considered "experimental" on fedora for a reason i suppose
2015-12-08 06:11:59	Twirl	well, its the only way to make chrome work so i need it
2015-12-08 06:12:04	Twirl	all other apps work fine
2015-12-08 06:12:10	sub_pop	i don't think i can even run it. this dumb nvidia card just crashes
2015-12-08 06:13:27	Twirl	sub_pop: that's sad
2015-12-08 06:13:43	Twirl	it's not the card's fault it's the drivers tho
2015-12-08 06:14:09	sub_pop	so, i installed the weston compositor
2015-12-08 06:14:13	sub_pop	and run it
2015-12-08 06:14:23	sub_pop	then you get a wayland session inside a window
2015-12-08 06:14:44	Twirl	man im not willing to do that to run chrome

2015-12-08 06:15:42	sub_pop	haha :P
2015-12-08 06:15:57	wiky	:( when I run the tests, django raises a exception 'django.db.utils.OperationalError: cannot drop the currently open database'. The database backend is 'django.contrib.gis.db.backends.postgis'. Any idea?
2015-12-08 06:16:15	Twirl	maybe there is some FTP client alternative
2015-12-08 06:16:19	Twirl	but filezilla is in the repos
2015-12-08 06:16:22	sub_pop	is there another process open that's holding the database?
2015-12-08 06:16:29	Twirl	the developer should fix it, not me
2015-12-08 06:16:32	Twirl	its not my job
2015-12-08 06:16:51	wiky	That exception is raised after running tests. So I believe it's because django cannot delete test database correctly.

2015-12-08 10:51:43	ovrflw0x	jhogarth, so what should i do? how should i keep this system updated?
2015-12-08 10:51:56	lyricnz_	Hi team. Just attempted to upgrade f22->23; did the 2.2GB of downloads; sudo dnf system-upgrade download --releasever=23; then....
2015-12-08 10:52:21	lyricnz_	sudo dnf system-upgrade reboot; # rebooted a couple of times (quickly) but no upgrade, and now my download appears to be gone.
2015-12-08 10:52:25	lyricnz_	IDeas how to diagnose?
2015-12-08 10:53:01	jhogarth	ovrflw0x, well given www.virtualbox.org is a well established domain first establish why you are having difficulties resloving the address ;)
2015-12-08 10:53:19	ovrflw0x	jhogarth, maybe my internet is down during boot
2015-12-08 10:53:33	jhogarth	otherwise use the command line (dnf update) and try to be sensible on recognising what needs restarting when (dnf needs-restarting can help... to an extent)
2015-12-08 10:53:43	jhogarth	it doesn't contact during boot

2015-12-08 10:54:59	lyricnz_	Yeah. Wierd. And annoying - internet is kindof slow here.
2015-12-08 10:55:03	jhogarth	lyricnz_, start with journalctl -b -1 too look at the last boot records - you shoudl see the output of the update process in the journal ... it's possible if you have 3rd party repos you have dependency issues blocking a clean upgrade so it auto rolls back

2015-12-08 13:15:58	storrgie	I'm having some issues getting LTE working on Fedora 23, this is new to me so I don't know really how to debug it. From what I gather I need ModemManager.service running (which it is), and then the gnome network manager application should be able to set up my LTE connection (with my SIM plugged in). Does anyone have this working and could help me debug?

2015-12-08 18:43:09	billings	I think I'd be more interested in creating a 'self-destruct' password that rather than decrypting, starts running a secure wipe

2015-12-08 18:43:56	atrus	that or a trucrypt-style thing. one password leaves it in a plain-boring filesystem, another password brings up your private information.
2015-12-08 18:44:14	jweiss	yeah, i wish linux distros did more to support this stuff, since it's the new reality

2015-12-08 18:44:30	billings	the only reason I crypt my laptop is because I keep my ssh private key on it and if its stolen I don't want to have to deal with that
2015-12-08 18:44:52	jweiss	distros should also write random bytes to the unused part of the drive during install. then a drive with an encrypted partition would look just like any other install

2015-12-08 21:27:14	Smrtz	I guess I need to create the 'ssl-cert' group, and make it the group-owner of /etc/ssl/private.  Am I right?

2015-12-08 21:49:53	cmecca	and then add it later.
2015-12-08 21:50:30	Kellin	Yeah.  It's a safety mechanism - there are a lot of Bad Things(tm) that can happen installing to a degraded array.
2015-12-08 21:51:05	cmecca	i wish there was like an 'expert' button though
2015-12-08 21:51:15	cmecca	i mean my choices right now are, order another disk
2015-12-08 21:51:17	cmecca	or dont use fedora.
2015-12-08 21:51:23	cmecca	and thats kinda crappy :\
2015-12-08 21:53:06	Kellin	well - just from the standpoint of a sysadmin - if the raid array is degraded, why upgrade the OS prior to having the raid stabilized?
2015-12-08 21:53:18	cmecca	the system has no OS on it
2015-12-08 21:53:21	cmecca	its just my new desktop :P

2015-12-08 21:53:40	cmecca	nah
2015-12-08 21:53:44	cmecca	the array doesnt exist
2015-12-08 21:53:54	Kellin	how many disks do you have now?

2015-12-08 21:57:38	cmecca	of course thats an option

2015-12-08 21:58:14	Kellin	put home on the two two 2TB disks - back up home and just build the array on the disks later, no re-install needed

2015-12-09 03:22:37	RayzrShrp	yeah i found that page but it doesnt list what nirik is suggesting
2015-12-09 03:22:57	dgtlphlk	it would depend if you're using keys too
2015-12-09 03:23:08	RayzrShrp	my asa does not use keys
2015-12-09 03:23:24	nirik	RayzrShrp: it does...
2015-12-09 03:23:30	nirik	it mentions that exact error.
2015-12-09 03:23:48	RayzrShrp	right but not your fix
2015-12-09 03:23:55	nirik	"my fix" ?
2015-12-09 03:24:21	nirik	you mean dgtlphlk's fix? which is also mentioned, but for a differrent error
2015-12-09 03:24:22	RayzrShrp	so i dont have a config file in my ~/.ssh directory, do I just create it and put that in there?
2015-12-09 03:24:26	nirik	yes
2015-12-09 03:25:32	RayzrShrp	now i get Bad owner or permissions on /home/scott/.ssh/config

2015-12-09 03:26:41	dgtlphlk	iirc it should be 700 by default and either 644 or 600 for the files

2015-12-09 03:43:39	overyander	so, i'm trying to use the file browser to connect to a linux server using ssh. what i read was that it will essentially be an scp gui. i'm trying to connect using the string ssh://root@ip i then get a pop-up asking me if i accept the fingerprint, i click yes. the problem is that the server i'm logging into uses an rsa key-pair for authentication and i don't know where/how to save the private key so that the file browser in fedora will use that to log in.
2015-12-09 03:44:24	[R]	overyander: ~/.ssh... make sure ssh from the command line works, then you can use stupid guis
2015-12-09 03:48:20	overyander	it keeps asking me for the pass phrase for the key. i did not create a pass phrase for the key when i made it, this key works just fine using winscp or putty from a windows machine... suggestions?

2015-12-09 03:51:09	dgtlphlk	it should work in guis

2015-12-09 03:51:59	overyander	in the gui it doesn't prompt for which key to use. when i just sshd in from cli i used ssh -i mykey.ppk root@ip
2015-12-09 03:52:11	fenrus02	that's an odd extension for ssh.
2015-12-09 03:52:27	fenrus02	also means your ~/.ssh/config file is lacking the proper paragraph telling it which key to use.
2015-12-09 03:52:39	overyander	it's what i logically thought of when i thought private key pair
2015-12-09 03:53:12	overyander	the ssh config is where i put in public keys isn't it?
2015-12-09 03:53:23	dgtlphlk	not really, its where ssh options are stored per user
2015-12-09 03:53:28	fenrus02	no.
2015-12-09 03:53:54	overyander	ok, there's only a file "known_hosts" in my users .ssh dir
2015-12-09 03:54:02	fenrus02	in your ~/.ssh/config file you can enter a "Host xyz.example.com" paragraph that has a IdentityFile directive .. this points to your key.
2015-12-09 03:54:03	dgtlphlk	just create the config file
2015-12-09 03:54:20	--	dgtlphlk is now known as dgtlchlk

2015-12-09 22:57:33	ffledgling	I have a question, how do I install a kernel I built from upstream linux source tree in Fedora?
2015-12-09 22:57:56	ffledgling	I've put in /boot/ and run grub-mkconfig, but it doesn't boot, so I'm missing something
2015-12-09 22:57:58	bodhizazen	make install
2015-12-09 22:58:03	bitlord	same as on any other distribution

2015-12-09 22:59:19	bodhizazen	ffledgling, make localmodconfig
2015-12-09 22:59:57	bodhizazen	you most likely did not apply patches you should have, applied patches you should not have, or mis-configured the kernel
2015-12-09 23:00:13	ffledgling	I simply ran make defconfig
2015-12-09 23:00:43	ffledgling	and I'm running inside a VM so I thought it'd be good to go, since there's no real hardware/drivers required

2015-12-09 23:02:28	TimeTravelDuck	hello. I have a Fedora 23 with cinnamon (one of the spins). I have installed Vmware 12 and the kernel modules compiled without problems. I have tried to launch vmware with root user and the normal user, but nothing happen. Did I miss some mandatory package? Can I find some instructions?
2015-12-09 23:02:38	bodhizazen	compiling custom kernels is poorly supported by most distros, including Fedora, as it is complex and the kernel developers know more then most of us
2015-12-09 23:02:46	bodhizazen	ffledgling, http://bodhizazen.net/Tutorials/kernel and good luck ;)
2015-12-09 23:03:10	ffledgling	bodhizazen: yeah, I've heard that one before, but gotta start somewhere
2015-12-09 23:03:37	bodhizazen	start with make localmodconfig ;)

2015-12-10 14:10:29	jhogarth	now if you start throwing random git libraries round ... well that just makes a whoel heap of mess to keep track of - and frankly by the time you've recahed needed to track config changes like that then you should probably be using a CM system of some nature ... even if it's a ssimple as ansible with the local connection

2015-12-10 14:11:27	jhogarth	if you just want to know of touch points for the application run it under strace with the file syscalls being tracked

2015-12-10 14:24:19	jhogarth	fedpop, there's also letsencrypt-nosudo that doesn't need root (obv requires something else serving up the challenge) and acme-tiny that also doesn't need root to run

2015-12-10 15:07:16	fenrus02	jhogarth, second half, how do you find what package owns those files?  "rpm -qf /path/to/file /path/to/other/file |sort -u"
2015-12-10 15:08:03	jhogarth	fenrus02, except that is only a runtime snapshot ... it won't catch a file being opened, read and closed (eg a config file that was missed in %files)
2015-12-10 15:08:25	jhogarth	and note the important bit of "not in rpmdb as owned"
2015-12-10 15:08:58	fenrus02	jhogarth, right.  the second half of the statement above does that for you.  it tells you what is and is not owned.
2015-12-10 15:09:07	jhogarth	if we're talking just in general yeah lsof can catch most ... but it doens't catch runtime behaviour overall
2015-12-10 15:09:34	fenrus02	jhogarth, if you really wanted ot know all of them, use audit instead. it's less overhead and less sorting than strace.
2015-12-10 15:10:01	jhogarth	ooh yes I like the idea of using auditd for it
2015-12-10 15:10:27	jhogarth	but i really do wonder how much overhead it's have versus a targetted strace that only reported file operations

2015-12-10 19:42:01	DOMF	Hello all - I just upgraded to Feodra 23 and it seems to have broken Vagrant - http://pastebin.com/zTuJ3haK  "cannot load such file -- /var/lib/vagrant/rgloader/loader"
2015-12-10 19:42:08	DOMF	Anyone have any idea about how to fix this?
2015-12-10 19:44:49	fedpop	DOMF I think the solution was mentioned here : https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Common_F23_bugs
2015-12-10 19:45:21	DOMF	are you talking about the "Upgrade path for Vagrant broken" section?
2015-12-10 19:45:41	DOMF	I saw that, I don't believe that applies to me, as I'm getting the upgrade just fine. I've also removed and re-installed vagrant with dnf
2015-12-10 19:45:45	DOMF	same error

2015-12-10 19:46:52	iSage	lib_modules_path could also be added to /etc/config-5.3.lua instead of patching cfg.lua
2015-12-10 19:49:11	Khaytsus	DOMF: rpmconf -a and other cleanup procedures?  Just to make sure you don't have any dangling config files?
2015-12-10 19:49:14	spot	iSage: thought about that, but I figured that users might have custom files there, want to minimize risk of failure
2015-12-10 19:50:01	iSage	hm, yep
2015-12-10 19:50:38	DOMF	Khaytsus, I probably do. Yep, ~/.vagrant.d/
2015-12-10 19:50:46	iSage	anyway, thank you for this
