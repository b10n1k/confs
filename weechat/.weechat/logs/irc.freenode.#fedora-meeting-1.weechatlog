2015-12-10 17:12:11	geppetto	I would change "are not permitted in the main Fedora repositories" with "are not permitted for use in specfiles in the main Fedora repositories"
2015-12-10 17:12:47	geppetto	Which clarifies that you can do something like scl-utils, which installs macros for use … but you just can't use them in official pkgdb packages

2015-12-10 17:19:54	geppetto	Hey
2015-12-10 17:20:19	tibbs|w	Sorry, not a good morning.
2015-12-10 17:20:38	racor	I am ambivalent. Not being a native English speaker, geppetto's wording to me doesn't change anything. Also, as long as COPRs don't have an formal role in Fedora, I don't see much reason to mention them.
2015-12-10 17:22:05	geppetto	racor: They are a way to easily make packages available to Fedora users
2015-12-10 17:22:30	mbooth	I think it's fair to mention COPRs -- It avoids us being questioned about what to do when a packager wants to do something non-standard and also
2015-12-10 17:22:36	geppetto	I think the idea was more to say "No, but you can do this which is more suited to what you want" Rahter than just "No"

2015-12-10 17:23:29	racor	geppetto: to me, they are private sandbox for inoffical uses. Not of any importance to us  at all.

2015-12-10 17:31:51	racor	geppetto: I already voted 0.
2015-12-10 17:31:55	orionp	So, can we get to 5 if we drop mentioning COPR?
2015-12-10 17:32:09	racor	orionp: yes
2015-12-10 17:32:18	geppetto	Or any other wording change you'd like Rathann or racor ?

2015-12-10 17:32:37	Rathann	COPR reference doesn't matter for me

2015-12-10 17:36:49	geppetto	Ok, I'd seen some updates
2015-12-10 17:36:58	geppetto	wasn't sure if we had anything to talk about
2015-12-10 17:37:02	tibbs|w	As far as I know, the ifdef-spaghetti method works.
2015-12-10 17:37:13	 *	geppetto nods
2015-12-10 17:37:20	tibbs|w	There was a mention of an extra macro containing the python major version or something.
2015-12-10 17:37:27	tibbs|w	I don't know if that went in or not.
2015-12-10 17:37:48	orionp	I think %python3_pkgversion may be missing from fedora - not sure why at this point
2015-12-10 17:38:18	orionp	It seems the python maintainers have dropped out of this....
2015-12-10 17:38:35	tibbs|w	Yes, that was the macro.
2015-12-10 17:38:55	tibbs|w	I thought you were going to just add it to redhat-rpm-config.
2015-12-10 17:39:10	tibbs|w	Really, pushing it through python isn't the best way.
2015-12-10 17:39:31	tibbs|w	I also recall that we were going to get a package added to the buildroot; do you remember what that package was?
2015-12-10 17:39:38	orionp	well, it's tied to the version of python3, so it seems to belong to that...
2015-12-10 17:39:52	geppetto	tibbs: I thought that was some extra macro package
2015-12-10 17:40:15	tibbs|w	The problem with the macros being in the python package is that we have to rev the python package to change the macros.
2015-12-10 17:40:46	tibbs|w	And that's often more difficult than anyone really wants it to be.  At one point things were held up becaue the python package didn't even build.
2015-12-10 17:40:53	orionp	Well, for that particular macro, that when you'd need to change it, but yeah, then you have a mess of them

2015-12-10 17:41:51	tibbs|w	And, yeah, this would add some kind of procedural dependency, but python doesn't really get upgraded all that often.  I think it could be handled.  Maybe even with a direct version dependency somewhere so we know that things have to be bumped.
2015-12-10 17:42:03	tibbs|w	But maybe after this stuff is stable it could move into the main python package.
2015-12-10 17:42:35	tibbs|w	Anyway, that has been swapped out of my brain for long enough that I've forgotten the details.  I wish I had more time.
