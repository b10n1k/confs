In channel description, I've clearly mentioned that it is an unofficial account. I'm planning to just share the links and updates through it. ( like  sharing the tweets from @fedora and posts from Fedora Magazine. ) I hope it is alright to
2015-12-03 12:37:35	deadrat	do so.

2015-12-04 01:17:11	jflory7	Lord_Drachenblut: Hiya! Yes, we're back on this week. At 9pm US EST!
2015-12-04 01:17:16	jflory7	So another 40 minutes from now.
2015-12-04 01:17:31	Lord_Drachenblut	ah gotcha... i thought it was eariler for some reason
2015-12-04 01:17:59	jflory7	Hahah, yeah, I just opened IRC back up... you gave me a small scare, made me thought I'd missed it! :D
2015-12-04 01:18:23	Lord_Drachenblut	ahhh sorry bout that mate
2015-12-04 01:18:32	jflory7	No worries, it's all good!
2015-12-04 01:19:02	Lord_Drachenblut	i discovered a new hdmi capture devices that are promosing and cheaper than the magewell card.
2015-12-04 01:19:25	Lord_Drachenblut	the febon 198 and it's 150 vs the 300 for the magewell card
2015-12-04 01:19:30	jflory7	Ohhh?
2015-12-04 01:19:37	jflory7	I've never played around much with capture devices!
2015-12-04 01:20:08	Lord_Drachenblut	and it's a uvc device so it's driver free and will work on linux
2015-12-04 01:20:09	Lord_Drachenblut	http://febon.blogspot.com/2014/08/febon198-usb30-uvc-hdmi-grabber-card.html
2015-12-04 01:20:48	Lord_Drachenblut	i still need to find out what kind of networking we are going to have available at the both to see if we are going to be able to live stream from the both
2015-12-04 01:22:14	Lord_Drachenblut	and scale still hasn't accepted either of my talks
2015-12-04 01:22:19	jflory7	Nice! A live stream would be super cool!
2015-12-04 01:22:21	Lord_Drachenblut	but they are adding new speakers every day
2015-12-04 01:22:30	jflory7	Fingers crossed for you, friend.
2015-12-04 01:22:59	Lord_Drachenblut	with a couple webcams and usb mics we can stream nicely
2015-12-04 01:23:38	Lord_Drachenblut	and if I get the febon or magewell we could hook up other computers and stream the desktops from them as well
2015-12-04 01:26:15	jflory7	Lord_Drachenblut++ Nice on the creativity! Hopefully I'll be able to tune into the stream.
2015-12-04 01:28:15	Lord_Drachenblut	jflory7: i'll probably use the fedora project youtube channel for it
2015-12-04 01:28:21	Lord_Drachenblut	or maybe twitch.....
2015-12-04 01:28:28	Lord_Drachenblut	but i'll see
2015-12-04 01:29:37	jflory7	Lord_Drachenblut: Definitely post to the mailing list once you have details finalized, I'll want to tune in for sure!
2015-12-04 01:29:48	Lord_Drachenblut	groovy
2015-12-04 01:30:05	Lord_Drachenblut	nice thing of doing this way is we could do interviews live from the booth
2015-12-04 01:30:40	Lord_Drachenblut	and I already have a couple samson q2u mic's that work nicely under linux that I can take with me.  I just need to get a case to use
2015-12-04 01:31:07	jflory7	Lord_Drachenblut: Maybe we could even do a Magazine article to help broadcast the stream to the greater user community. :)
2015-12-04 01:31:22	Lord_Drachenblut	how so?
2015-12-04 01:33:25	jflory7	Lord_Drachenblut: We could probably get an article published saying, "Hey, here's this event, the Fedora Ambassadors will be there, and there will be a live stream!"
2015-12-04 01:33:39	jflory7	Might get a lot more eyes to it too.
2015-12-04 01:33:51	Lord_Drachenblut	ah gotcha
2015-12-04 01:34:05	jflory7	Although we'd want to check the integrity and details of the streaming for sure before we publicly proclaim it's available. :)
2015-12-04 01:34:12	Lord_Drachenblut	and maybe we could post up an article when the stream is up embedding the stream in
2015-12-04 01:34:24	Lord_Drachenblut	right
2015-12-04 01:34:43	jflory7	I think we'd be able to do that, yeah!
2015-12-04 01:34:57	jflory7	Would *also* be great ammo for the CommBlog. That's something that any Ambassador can write to too.
2015-12-04 01:35:15	jflory7	Magazine is a bit more stringent on editing and everything, but the CommBlog is much looser and intended as a contributor hub.
2015-12-04 01:35:59	Lord_Drachenblut	yea I need to get write a post for that consedering i'm trying to run for a famsco seat

2015-12-04 01:41:04	jflory7	Lord_Drachenblut: Oh, awesome! If you need help for that, I recommend checking out #fedora-commops to help expedite getting your interview up. I'm also one of the people who does a lot with it, so you're welcome to poke me anytime for help!
2015-12-04 01:41:06	Lord_Drachenblut	the mixtrack is supported by mixxx
2015-12-04 01:41:22	jflory7	Ooh, who doesn't like new toys?
2015-12-04 01:41:38	jflory7	Hey, award3535.
2015-12-04 01:41:56	Lord_Drachenblut	and the launchpad mini is supported under luppp as well as I found a python script that looks like it will turn the launchpad mini into a scrolling banner
