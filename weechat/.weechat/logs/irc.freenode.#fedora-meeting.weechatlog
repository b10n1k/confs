2015-12-10 18:10:30	nirik	so, ansible 2.0 is going to be out "soon"
2015-12-10 18:10:39	nirik	There's an rc2 available now, and a few fixes after that.
2015-12-10 18:11:00	nirik	I've been trying to work with the ansible upstream folks to test and find bugs
2015-12-10 18:11:13	-->	sayan (~sayanchow@fedora/sayan) has joined #fedora-meeting
2015-12-10 18:11:18	nirik	The good news is that our playbooks are now almost 100% ready/working with 2.0
2015-12-10 18:11:40	nirik	There's a glance_image bug that prevents the fed-cloud09 host playbook from finishing and I think thats all.
2015-12-10 18:12:06	nirik	The bad news is: our scripts and handlers need re-writing
2015-12-10 18:12:32	nirik	I'm going to try and look at that in the coming weeks, but if anyone else has cycles it would be great to help.

2015-12-10 18:12:59	lmacken	hm, it says they are aiming for 100% backwards compat with 2.0?
2015-12-10 18:12:59	nirik	So, some things about 2.0
2015-12-10 18:13:05	nirik	for playbooks, yep.
2015-12-10 18:13:09	lmacken	ah
2015-12-10 18:13:10	odin2016	that something that apprentices could help with?
2015-12-10 18:13:20	nirik	but the api has never been stable or something they said you could depend on
2015-12-10 18:13:42	nirik	odin2016: sure. You may need to test in a home env, but that shouldn't be too hard.
2015-12-10 18:14:05	odin2016	nirik, oh good.. gives me a reason to do more than read on standing it up...
2015-12-10 18:14:22	nirik	https://github.com/ansible/ansible/blob/devel/CHANGELOG.md is the changelog
2015-12-10 18:14:39	nirik	there's lots and lots of fixes to the core setup that should make it easier to maintain
2015-12-10 18:14:48	nirik	and some nifty new features we could use...
2015-12-10 18:15:05	nirik	some interesting ones:
2015-12-10 18:15:17	nirik	block/rescue/always blocks: http://docs.ansible.com/ansible/playbooks_blocks.html
2015-12-10 18:15:42	nirik	https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/playbooks_strategies.html is also likely to be handy for us
2015-12-10 18:16:44	nirik	FYI, it takes about 4.5 hours to run over all our playbooks. With a different strategy it could be a good deal faster.
2015-12-10 18:17:20	pingou	sounds nice
2015-12-10 18:17:34	nirik	There are also a bunch of new openstack modules... but we can keep using the existing ones until we get around to moving
2015-12-10 18:18:22	nirik	so, things that need working on:
2015-12-10 18:18:45	puiterwijk	nirik: I'm switching my own setup to the new modules, so can look at fixing the Fedora ones by the time we're upgrading openstack
2015-12-10 18:18:48	nirik	all our callback_plugins don't work with the new api: http://infrastructure.fedoraproject.org/cgit/ansible.git/tree/callback_plugins
2015-12-10 18:18:51	threebean	sweet new features :)
2015-12-10 18:19:20	nirik	I dont think the filter_plugins work, but we may not need all of them either

2015-12-10 18:19:56	nirik	puiterwijk: sure, but we shouldn't move until we commit to staying on 2.0 on batcave...
2015-12-10 18:20:24	nirik	a number of scripts don't work: http://infrastructure.fedoraproject.org/cgit/ansible.git/tree/scripts
2015-12-10 18:20:34	nirik	(some of those are just shell scripts they work fine)
2015-12-10 18:20:41	puiterwijk	nirik: sure. But that's going to be a little time anyway :).

2015-12-10 18:22:51	odin2016	not yet...
2015-12-10 18:23:10	nirik	note that ansible 2.0 still isn't python3... that discussion was pushed to post 2.0 release...
2015-12-10 18:23:59	aldapetr	hi, late..
2015-12-10 18:24:28	nirik	also, it's easy to test a ansible version from git, just check it out and 'source hacking/env-setup' and it will use that ansible.
2015-12-10 18:25:22	nirik	ok, if nothing else on ansible 2.0...

2015-12-10 18:26:11	nirik	anyone want to teach about something next week? or have ideas what you would like to learn about?
2015-12-10 18:27:10	threebean	the new package namespacing work that some of us have been poking at could be an interesting topic.
2015-12-10 18:27:31	threebean	also, I could talk about PDC at some point too.  maybe after the holidays, though.
2015-12-10 18:27:52	nirik	yeah,
2015-12-10 18:28:02	nirik	we have next week's meeting then I think we skip the next two
2015-12-10 18:28:31	nirik	ok, I can ask around and see if I can come up with something. ;)
2015-12-10 18:28:37	nirik	any other general items for open floor?
2015-12-10 18:28:39	pingou	btw, ftr pkgdb2/distgit in stg is currently broken
2015-12-10 18:28:47	pingou	for some definition of broken
2015-12-10 18:28:53	nirik	ok
2015-12-10 18:29:08	pingou	but that's in purpose, so don't worry and if you're not sure if some behavior is expected, feel free to ask :)
2015-12-10 18:29:18	nirik	fair enough.
2015-12-10 18:29:19	pingou	(pkgdb2 in stg already has the namespacing in its UI)
2015-12-10 18:29:48	pingou	so to be precise, both pkgdb2 and dist-git are working, just the link in between isn't so, some things won't work
2015-12-10 18:29:56	nirik	FYI, I have also been working this week (as I often do) on reducing the number of emails that get sent to people... hopefully it will be at an all time low for the holidays. ;)
2015-12-10 18:30:06	threebean	+1 :)
2015-12-10 18:30:22	nirik	if we could try and address chronic nagios alerters too that would be good.

2015-12-10 18:32:46	threebean	can't recall if there was a reason we stopped.
2015-12-10 18:33:01	threebean	maybe just the change in meeting format we tried.
2015-12-10 18:33:04	nirik	I think we had a bit there were it was all connection problems beyond our control.
2015-12-10 18:33:11	nirik	but yeah, could be that too

2015-12-10 22:09:31	jflory7	So instead of Picard---
2015-12-10 22:09:38	jflory7	I completely finished + fleshed out the Mumble article.
2015-12-10 22:09:50	jflory7	It is 100% content ready, pending a featured image and maybe one more look-over.
2015-12-10 22:10:09	jflory7	With my finals coming up, I want to spend more time writing the Picard article while it has my full focus.
2015-12-10 22:10:19	jflory7	I did get a good chunk of it done, though.

2015-12-10 22:11:03	stickster	jflory7: So would you say, Mumble tomorrow (pending image), then schedule Picard article to publish next week or the week after?
2015-12-10 22:11:22	jflory7	stickster: If we could schedule Picard for same time next week, I think that's doable.
2015-12-10 22:11:28	jflory7	Starting next Thursday, I'll be finished

2015-12-10 22:16:15	stickster	jhogarth: Did you write an article previously for us? (Not necessarily systemd)
2015-12-10 22:16:25	stickster	jflory7: They might have just been ideas in my head :-D
2015-12-10 22:16:32	jflory7	stickster: jhogarth did LetsEncrypt stuff :)
2015-12-10 22:16:38	jhogarth	stickster, the letsencrypt one pending discussion today
2015-12-10 22:16:46	stickster	Oh right. Sorry, it's been a lot of synaptic loss since last year.
2015-12-10 22:17:02	jflory7	So, since we're looking at the systemd article now:

2015-12-10 22:17:32	stickster	I set up some test VMs today so I can work on the article tomorrow
2015-12-10 22:17:39	jflory7	Ah, so you do have that one, stickster?
2015-12-10 22:17:44	stickster	yup yup
2015-12-10 22:17:47	jflory7	I think that might be a wrap to the series, then

2015-12-10 22:18:34	stickster	yeah
2015-12-10 22:18:42	stickster	we can do one at any time afterward, of course

2015-12-10 22:19:15	stickster	OK, it sounds like we have a plan for next week now
2015-12-10 22:19:40	Kohane	I'll write some an article about the programmes I use as translator and designer.
2015-12-10 22:19:49	Kohane	If you like.
2015-12-10 22:20:03	jflory7	Yeah, I forgot to mention the LetsEncrypt article - that one is hotstuff and could definitely go out next week. Preferably, too.

2015-12-10 22:20:29	jflory7	Kohane: If you wanted to write a few pitches up, that would be *awesome*!
2015-12-10 22:20:43	stickster	Agreed, don't limit it to one if you don't want.
2015-12-10 22:20:50	Kohane	Yeah! Sure!!

2015-12-10 22:27:37	stickster	q.v. contributory infringement
2015-12-10 22:27:38	jflory7	stickster: I think the RPMFusion stuff was stripped out, or it should be okay to remove.
2015-12-10 22:27:48	jflory7	I mentioned it to Kohane and she was going to save it for a Fedora Planet article. :)

2015-12-10 22:29:19	 *	stickster would recommend we not worry about publishing anything either Fri Dec 25 or Fri Jan 1
2015-12-10 22:30:00	jflory7	puiterwijk: Cool, awesome! So do you think you could have it ready for review by 12/20ish? That would give some time to review and edit - I can help getting it ready for that upcoming Thursday.
2015-12-10 22:30:04	jflory7	stickster: Agreed
2015-12-10 22:30:15	puiterwijk	jflory7: absolutely.
2015-12-10 22:30:35	Kohane	Perfect
2015-12-10 22:30:40	jflory7	puiterwijk: Perfect, awesome. :) When you get it finished, shoot it over to the mailing list for review.
2015-12-10 22:30:52	puiterwijk	Will do
2015-12-10 22:30:55	stickster	jflory7: So looking at https://lists.fedoraproject.org/pipermail/marketing/2015-December/018515.html ...
2015-12-10 22:31:14	stickster	We also have a HDYF currently scheduled for Thu Dec 17, are we just going to pump those out whenever available?
2015-12-10 22:32:02	jflory7	stickster: I made a mistake this week looking at the schedule. I mistook the publication date for systemd on Tuesday, so I pushed the HDYF article out early because I thought we missed a day. However, that was not the case. So this week's publication was a mishap.
2015-12-10 22:32:31	jflory7	Silly error on my part
2015-12-10 22:32:38	stickster	Ah, OK
2015-12-10 22:32:41	stickster	no worries
2015-12-10 22:32:58	stickster	I think Charles had a few extra coming soon... we can maybe line them up for the holiday weeks
2015-12-10 22:33:13	jflory7	Yeah, I will also work with him on those too once I finish with the semester
2015-12-10 22:33:51	Kohane	Yeah, one of those HDYF is about me :D
2015-12-10 22:33:53	jflory7	I know he's been super active with them and he mentioned in channel a few days ago he had some more ready to go
2015-12-10 22:34:14	cydrobolt	Kohane, ooh
2015-12-10 22:34:23	Kohane	What?
2015-12-10 22:34:27	jflory7	Kohane: Nice! cproffit has been on the ball with it
2015-12-10 22:34:31	cydrobolt	HDYF :)

2015-12-10 22:35:07	Kohane	I still have some questions to answer.
2015-12-10 22:35:10	stickster	#info Ignore earlier #info on schedule from "next week" topic
2015-12-10 22:35:23	Kohane	But yeah, there's one about me
2015-12-10 22:36:18	-->	jhogarth (~jhogarth@5ec2358a.skybroadband.com) has joined #fedora-meeting
2015-12-10 22:36:22	stickster	So I'm cool with that schedule, fwiw... jflory7, is the LetsEncrypt ready to go?
2015-12-10 22:36:28	jflory7	Awesome.
2015-12-10 22:36:38	jflory7	stickster: And yes, I think jhogarth added everything he wanted to it. :)
2015-12-10 22:36:46	Kohane	Then what is the real #info from next week if we have to ignore that one?
2015-12-10 22:36:47	jflory7	I did a quick review last night but it seemed pretty solid in my opinion
2015-12-10 22:36:56	jflory7	Kohane: I think we're about to clarify.
2015-12-10 22:36:56	jhogarth	i'm happy with the present state of it :)

2015-12-10 22:37:10	jflory7	Then I give a +1 to LetsEncrypt for next Monday
2015-12-10 22:37:21	jflory7	Should give it a little more time to sync across the mirrors too, just in case
2015-12-10 22:37:23	Kohane	Yeah, I like it too.
2015-12-10 22:37:28	 *	jflory7 isn't sure how long that stuff takes anyways
2015-12-10 22:37:57	puiterwijk	jflory7: after it's hit stable, I'd say a day or two max
2015-12-10 22:38:09	jflory7	puiterwijk: Oh, lol, then it's probably done by now then
2015-12-10 22:38:14	stickster	#info Revised schedule: Mon Dec 14 - LetsEncrypt; Wed Dec 16 - systemd; Fri Dec 18 - nuntius; Mon Dec 21 - Picard; Wed Dec 23 - Cinnamon; Thu Dec 24 - Varnish
2015-12-10 22:38:18	jflory7	Hit stable Monday/Tuesday
2015-12-10 22:38:21	puiterwijk	I can easily check for you. Ping me after the meeting
2015-12-10 22:38:24	stickster	^^ does that look OK jflory7? puiterwijk? jhogarth? Kohane?
2015-12-10 22:38:37	 *	jflory7 nods
2015-12-10 22:38:38	jflory7	+1
2015-12-10 22:38:42	stickster	coolio
2015-12-10 22:38:42	puiterwijk	ack
2015-12-10 22:38:45	Kohane	Perfect!
2015-12-10 22:38:46	jhogarth	it got pushed to stable repos last night

2015-12-10 22:39:01	jflory7	puiterwijk: What's up?
2015-12-10 22:39:03	Kohane	Yes...
2015-12-10 22:39:12	jflory7	jhogarth: Oh, whoops, guess I mistook it. Should definitely be set over the weekend, then
2015-12-10 22:39:14	puiterwijk	jflory7: "ack" means "Acknowledged", as in I agree
2015-12-10 22:39:19	stickster	jflory7: Are you going to be around on keyboard/net that week?
2015-12-10 22:39:26	jflory7	puiterwijk: Ohhh, okay, I mistook. :)
2015-12-10 22:39:34	jflory7	stickster: Yes.
2015-12-10 22:39:36	puiterwijk	Oh, and I might have a new post upcoming about Atomic/PRM-OSTree (update of my old blogpost). But I'll send a pitch to the list
2015-12-10 22:39:52	jflory7	puiterwijk++ Awesome news!
2015-12-10 22:39:53	stickster	puiterwijk: We're hurting for material for that week, so you might just want to start writing :-D
2015-12-10 22:40:14	puiterwijk	stickster: hah. As said, I've got most of it already: http://patrick.uiterwijk.org/2014/01/21/rpm-ostree/
2015-12-10 22:40:20	puiterwijk	Just need to update it to the new syntax etc
2015-12-10 22:40:41	jhogarth	stickster, if you don't mind me pitching older blog articles I have some I can polish up and put on the pitch queue that migth be interesting - NetworkManager, Systemd and I'm about to publish a Polkit one for instance ;)
2015-12-10 22:40:46	Kohane	Looks very nice...
2015-12-10 22:40:48	stickster	jflory7: The reason I asked the question was, we probably need someone to do the hard part of making sure articles are ready to go that week. Ideally they are all "Scheduled" in the WP instance by next Friday Dec 18
2015-12-10 22:41:11	jflory7	stickster: I can confidently take that responsibility
2015-12-10 22:41:17	Kohane	Network Manager would be awesome, me think
2015-12-10 22:41:17	stickster	And then scheduled to come out e.g. Mon Dec 28, Wed Dec 30, Thu Dec 31
2015-12-10 22:41:30	 *	jflory7 nods
2015-12-10 22:41:32	stickster	jflory7: Without knowing what they are it will be hard to do graphics in advance
2015-12-10 22:41:50	jflory7	stickster: Right. That's my concern as well since I lack Inkscape-foo
2015-12-10 22:41:55	stickster	HDYF kind of take care of their own
2015-12-10 22:41:59	stickster	i.e. crop a photo, done
2015-12-10 22:42:04	jflory7	Right.

2015-12-10 22:42:20	jflory7	nuntius, Picard, Cinnamon, Varnish, would all definitely need images
2015-12-10 22:42:41	jflory7	I think even in their current state, images could be made now
2015-12-10 22:42:57	Kohane	Yeah, pictures of the installation process...
2015-12-10 22:43:01	Kohane	I haven't
2015-12-10 22:43:08	stickster	We really need ryanlerch for some of these... I'm not super good at coming up with ideas
2015-12-10 22:43:44	stickster	I'm going to "volunteer" him to be in charge of getting them done by end of next week
2015-12-10 22:43:52	 *	jflory7 nods
2015-12-10 22:43:57	Kohane	stickster ideas for?
2015-12-10 22:44:08	jflory7	Kohane: Designs for the featured images for the articles.
2015-12-10 22:44:09	stickster	#action ryanlerch get featured images ready for all remaining posts for Dec 14 - Dec 31
2015-12-10 22:44:34	stickster	jflory7: If we're smart, also keep this in mind: Hold one HDYF article (assuming we have a leftover) for Tue Jan 5, after we come back
2015-12-10 22:44:35	puiterwijk	stickster: meeting, n.: An assembly of people coming together to decide what person or department not represented in the room must solve a problem.? :-)
2015-12-10 22:44:38	Kohane	Ah, thanks
2015-12-10 22:44:45	stickster	puiterwijk: CORRECT
2015-12-10 22:44:47	jflory7	If you take a look through the Magazine, you'll see that all of the articles have images in a Magazine-ish sort of theme.
2015-12-10 22:45:02	jflory7	stickster: Noted.
2015-12-10 22:45:20	stickster	since everyone will be in "ugh, catch up" mode
2015-12-10 22:45:51	stickster	#info We don't have a solid schedule for Dec 28-31 yet :-( but hope that puiterwijk + cprofitt will come up with things
2015-12-10 22:46:13	Kohane	From now on until February, I'll get bored to death. Anything you may need I'll be happy to do it.
2015-12-10 22:46:19	Kohane	If I can, of course
2015-12-10 22:46:21	jflory7	So if images are taken care of, I can handle publication responsibilities for holiday week. However, "worst case scenario", would it be "extremely bad" for me to push an article with an image of my own choosing (assuming valid license) if a featured image is not ready?
2015-12-10 22:46:29	jflory7	Assuming there is no featured image.
2015-12-10 22:46:48	jflory7	Or would it be better to just not push and wait?

2015-12-10 22:47:41	stickster	I don't think puiterwijk would agree that holds for infrastructure. But this is publishing.

2015-12-10 22:48:26	puiterwijk	(though that was required unfortunately, but well)
2015-12-10 22:48:52	Kohane	It's not that bad...
2015-12-10 22:48:56	stickster	jflory7: Not sure there's much more to discuss today
2015-12-10 22:49:02	stickster	It's awesome we got ahead last week -- that really helped
2015-12-10 22:49:24	stickster	If we can try to make a practice of that starting in January when we return... gangbusters!

2015-12-10 22:50:30	jflory7	Finals time. :P
2015-12-10 22:50:38	puiterwijk	jflory7: good luck with that
2015-12-10 22:50:43	jflory7	puiterwijk: Thanks!!
2015-12-10 22:50:54	Kohane	jflory7 do you need help?
2015-12-10 22:50:57	stickster	jflory7: Understood. Between Ryan and myself, I think we can handle all editing until then
2015-12-10 22:51:02	stickster	and smoothly handoff for holiday time :-)
